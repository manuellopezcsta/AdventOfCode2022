This is for the event https://adventofcode.com/2022 
This are the scripts I made to solve the problems.
I priorizate simplicity over well written code in some of them. (You were given a challenge and then a second part with the same input).
Lastly , I used Python to solve them to keep practicing the language.
Happy Holidays! # AdventOfCode2022
